# Number-Guesser

I'm learning python and this a number guessing game.
Computer selects a random number between 1 to 100 and user has to guess that number.
The user gets to select 2 levels, 'easy' (5 attempts) or 'hard' (10 attempts).
User  guesses the number & gets a clue if number is too high or too low.
If user guesses the number correctly within the available attempts, he wins.
